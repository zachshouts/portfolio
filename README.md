## Overview

I created this portfolio for one reason, and it's that I wanted a way to show pieces of my resume in a fun way. My portfolio is a place to see some of my skills and learn a bit about me. Through this portfolio I am able to show off some of my projects, provide a little more information about who I am along with access to my resume, and provide a way to contact me.
